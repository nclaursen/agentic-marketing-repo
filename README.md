# Agentic Marketing Workflow

A structured, motion-based marketing operating system for AI-assisted execution.

This is not a prompt collection.

It is a coordination layer.

It exists because most AI marketing usage creates isolated assets instead of aligned systems.

---

## The Problem

AI makes it easy to produce content.

It does not make it easy to produce coherence.

Without structure:
- Enterprise messaging drifts
- Partner communication fragments
- Campaigns disconnect from revenue motions
- Execution depends on senior intuition
- Strategy lives in slide decks, not daily work

This framework fixes that.

---

## What This Is

An agentic workflow architecture that:

- Routes work through revenue motions
- Injects context before execution
- Preserves narrative consistency
- Allows autonomy without chaos
- Scales across teams with mixed seniority

It turns AI from a writing assistant into a structured marketing system.

## Core Ideas

1. Marketing serves revenue motions, not channels.
2. Context precedes content.
3. Narrative consistency beats creative randomness.
4. Structure enables autonomy.
5. AI should coordinate, not improvise strategy.

---

## Architecture

The system consists of:

- Core control agents
- Motion engines
- Execution wrappers
- Structured SOP templates

Everything lives under `/agents`.

---

## Who This Is For

- B2B companies
- Hybrid sales + product-led organizations
- Partner-led ecosystems
- Teams with uneven seniority
- Operators who want structure without bureaucracy

---

## How To Use

1. Copy the `/agents` folder into your project.
2. Customize `agents/core/context-layer.md` with your positioning.
3. Start interactions with the orchestrator (added in step 2).
4. Let motion engines define structure.
5. Route to execution agents.
6. Pass through quality gate before publishing.

See `INSTALLATION.md` for setup.
See `EXAMPLE-WORKFLOWS.md` for real scenarios.
