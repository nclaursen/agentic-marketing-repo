# Quality Gate

Before publishing or handing off to stakeholders, check:

1) Alignment: Does this match `context-layer`?
2) Motion fit: Does it clearly support the chosen motion?
3) Differentiation: Is the “why us” obvious?
4) Proof: Is there at least one credibility signal?
5) CTA: Is the next step clear and appropriate?
6) Metric: Is success measurable?

## Output

- Pass / Revise
- If Revise: list the smallest set of edits needed (max 5)
