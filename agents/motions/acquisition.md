# Acquisition Motion

Use when the goal is new demand: leads, trials, demos, inbound pipeline.

## Inputs
Use the orchestrator brief + context-layer.

If missing, assume:
- Funnel stage = Awareness or Consideration
- Metric = qualified leads or demo requests

## Workflow
1) Clarify offer (what are we asking people to do?)
2) Pick 1 primary channel + 1 support channel
3) Define the “message spine” (problem → value → proof → CTA)
4) Produce assets in smallest useful set

## Output (always)
- Offer:
- Primary channel:
- Support channel:
- Message spine (4 bullets):
- Assets to produce (3–7 max):
- Success metric:

## Suggested execution agents
- copy (landing/email)
- social (distribution)
- seo (if evergreen topic)
- cro (if landing involved)

If producing a landing page or paid campaign: run quality-gate before final.
