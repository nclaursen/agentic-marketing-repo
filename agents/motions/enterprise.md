# Enterprise Motion

Use when the goal is sales-led pipeline, large accounts, committees, or high-trust evaluation.

## Inputs
Use orchestrator brief + context-layer.

If buyer roles aren’t provided, assume:
- economic buyer
- technical evaluator
- champion

## Workflow
1) Frame the risk (what goes wrong if they choose poorly?)
2) Anchor differentiation (why your approach reduces risk)
3) Select proof (logos, case studies, security, years, outcomes)
4) Handle top objections (3 max)
5) Produce sales-aligned assets

## Output (always)
- Buyer roles:
- Risk framing (1–2 lines):
- Differentiation (1–2 lines):
- Proof to use (bullets):
- Top objections + responses (max 3):
- Assets to produce:
- Success metric:

## Suggested execution agents
- copy (enterprise page, one-pager)
- competitor alternatives (if comparison needed)
- cro (if landing/page involved)

Always run quality-gate for enterprise assets.
