# Expansion Motion

Use when the goal is growth from existing customers: add-ons, training, upgrades, retention.

## Inputs
Use orchestrator brief + context-layer.

If trigger isn’t provided, assume:
- a usage milestone

- a renewal moment

## Workflow
1) Identify trigger + the “why now”
2) Attach value to an outcome (time saved, risk reduced, revenue gained)
3) Reduce friction (simple next step, low risk)
4) Produce smallest campaign that can run (email + in-product + sales/CS note)

## Output (always)
- Trigger:
- Offer:
- Outcome framing (bullets):
- Friction reducers (bullets):
- Assets to produce:
- Success metric:

## Suggested execution agents

Run quality-gate for pricing, packaging, and upgrade flows.
