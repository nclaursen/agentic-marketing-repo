# Partner Motion

Use when the goal is partner acquisition, activation, enablement, or partner-led pipeline.

## Inputs
Use orchestrator brief + context-layer.

If partner tier isn’t provided, assume “mid-size agency”.

## Workflow
1) Define partner value in partner language (margin, recurring revenue, differentiation)
2) Define “what to sell” (offer packaging partners can repeat)
3) Provide proof that reduces partner risk
4) Produce enablement assets + a simple co-marketing play

## Output (always)
- Partner profile:
- Partner value proposition (1–2 lines):
- Repeatable offer packaging (bullets):
- Proof to use:
- Enablement assets to produce:
- Co-marketing play (3–5 steps):
- Success metric:

## Suggested execution agents
- copy (partner page, partner kit copy)
- social (partner-facing posts)
- seo (if partner recruitment page is searchable)

Run quality-gate for partner program messaging and recruitment pages.
